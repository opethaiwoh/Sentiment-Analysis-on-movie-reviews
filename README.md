# sentimental-Analysis



##  Steps

a) Read all the above data files (.csv and .txt) in python Pandas DataFrame.

b) By using both CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer separately of the sklearn library, I performed the Logistic regression classification in the IMDb dataset
and evaluated the accuracies in the test set.

c) Classified the Amazon dataset using Logistic Regression and Neural Network (two hidden layers) and compare the performances and show the confusion matrices.

d) Generated classification model with K-NN algorithms.

e) Fit and test the model for different values for K (from 1 to 5) using a for loop and record and plot the KNNâ€™s testing accuracy in a variable (scores).
